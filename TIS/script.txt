That might sound like a lot of information, but it's not enough yet, 
Visiting the open office to see what people do in their work place, after an introduction ofc,
Open office has different teams, working in different parts, different language but they all work on the same project,
We tried to interview two of the software specialist there, and we got to know that each team members has a profession usually in one language with knowledge of other languages, and they work differently but with the same methodology, and it sounded cool,
Then lastly was sangfore , it's a place of Cyber security and technology, which they present one of the innovations there, and it was indeed incredible,
